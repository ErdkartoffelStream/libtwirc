# twirc

twirc will be a minimal Twitch IRC library written in C. There will be no support for IRC features that aren't part of Twitch's IRC implementation. On the other hand, some IRCv3 features, like `CAP REQ` will be implemented in order to be compatible with Twitch IRC. This is currently a work in progress, and a pretty early one. Don't even try to use this yet.

Part of the development currently happens live on Twitch: [twitch.tv/domsson](https://twitch.tv/domsson)
